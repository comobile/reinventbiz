                    <h2>What is the goal of this hackathon?</h2>
                    <p>Imagine, design, and build a more human and truly social enterprise - nothing less! Or, more practically speaking: The goal is to create concepts for products, services, and tools that translate values such as transparency, fairness, inclusiveness, and empowerment into tangible, personal experiences, and to develop practical solutions that allow companies and their people to live up to their ideals in their day-to-day decision-making and behaviors.</p>
                    <p>We don't expect this hackathon to produce any silver bullets, nor do we aim to “productize away” the deep and complex challenges of a moral economy and a more human enterprise. But we are poised to spawn a conversation by tackling concrete problem spaces that might inspire further-reaching, broader solutions.</p>

                    <h2>When will the hackathon take place?</h2>
                    <p>Saturday, June 9, 9 am - 10 pm and Sunday, June 10, 9 am - 6 pm.</p>
